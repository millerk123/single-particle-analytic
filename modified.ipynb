    "# Single-particle motion workbook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an investigation into single-particle motion within a laser.  It was developed by Kyle Miller based on notes from Professor W.B. Mori's graduate class in which exact analytical solutions of the particle motion are obtained. An improvement for the expansion in these notes was found by Kyle Miller and is presented here. Some of the calculations have also been presented by J. Yang, R. Craxton, and M. Haines, \"Explicit general solutions to relativistic electron dynamics in plane-wave electromagnetic fields and simulations of ponderomotive acceleration,\" Plasma Phys. Contr. Fusion **53**, 125006 (2011).  This notebook can also be used to explore the accuracy of the equation of motion (Boris push and extensions) used in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for the motion of a single-particle in the analytical fields of a plane wave.   Parameters such as the laser intensity as well as initial phase can be varied to compare results against theory."

    "where $\\xi\\equiv z-ct$. In class we showed that for a single particle interacting with such a wave two quanities are conserved: $\\gamma-p_z/mc$ and $p_x+qA/c$ (the canonical momemtum in the translationally invariant direction).  If we initialize a particle in a laser with constant amplitude $A(\\xi)=A_0$ and with zero initial velocity at $x=z=0$ and $\\phi=\\pi/2$ (or any $\\phi=(4n+1)\\pi/2)$, then we showed that you can express the longitudinal motion $z(t)$ as a drift plus some oscillation.  An explicit solution for this was given in the class notes as\n",

Following the procedures in the notes,   one can extend the theory to include cases where particles do not start at rest and/or start at different phases of the laser. For the rest of this workbook, analytical solutions will be taken from Yang et al., which allow for general initial conditions of the particle and phase of the laser."

    "Below you can run OSIRIS simulations in which a laser propagates towards a particle that is either starting at rest or already in motion. The trajectories of various quantities for the particles are plotted along with theory curves. You can choose your own parameters for the laser amplitude ($A_0$), initial phase deviation from $\\pi/2$ (could be thought of as $\\delta \\phi$; in input deck below $\\phi$ is given in *units of degrees*), and initial longitudinal proper velocity of the particle ($u_{z0}=\\gamma v_{z0}$).  You will also be able to run with various field solvers and particle pushers.  The laser profile rises rapidly, is flat over a large region, and then falls rapidly. The rise and fall taper off smoothly to zero.   This is necessary to avoid unphysical results from the rise and fall of the laser.\n",

    "The two field solvers available are the Yee and Fei solvers.  The Yee solver is a standard among PIC codes, but has an imperfect dispersion relation for light waves in vacuum.  The Fei (yes, he is your TA) solver uses a 16-point stencil in the longitudinal direction to correct for dispersion errors in solving Maxwell's equations as well as for offset electric and magnetic fields in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The six particle pushers are Boris (`standard`), Vay (`vay`), conditional Vay (`cond_vay`), Cary (`cary`), full rotation (`fullrot`), and Euler (`euler`).  The standard Boris push is the most common used in PIC codes.  The Vay pusher preserves the $\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B}$ velocity but is not volume-preserving, and is useful when particles attain very high energies (for large values of $A_0$); it can also lead to the magnetic field doing work.  The conditional Vay pusher uses the standard Boris push for particles with $\\gamma<5$ and the Vay pusher otherwise.  The Cary pusher preserves the $\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B}$ velocity like the Vay pusher, but it is also volume-preserving, like the standard Boris push.  The full rotation and Euler pushers are like the standard Boris push but perform the $\\vec B$ field rotation exactly, and should be identical for our purposes."
